            <h3 class="who__subtitle">Our History</h3>
            <p class="who__intro">Denton Unitarian Fellowship was founded in 1949 by a group of religious liberals who wanted their children to have some religious education in ethics and humanism. Our building was designed by Tom and Isabell Miller, inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright, and it was completed in 1959. Since then we have had a number of part-time ministers and one full-time minister, Rev. Pamela Wat, who has served the congregation since 2010. DUUF has been a certified &ldquo;Welcoming Congregation&rdquo; - a certification given for the congregation’s work in study, self-examination and work to be welcoming to LGBTQ+ people—since 2002.</p>

                    <p>Rev. Wat began as Minister at DUUF in September 2010. She has a B.F.A. in Related Arts with a concentration in Dance from Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, an M.A. in Creative Arts/Interdisciplinary Arts from San Francisco State University and a Master of Divinity from San Francisco Theological Seminary.

Wat lives in Denton with her spouse Erik and their cats Happy and Ravioli and dog Clyde. Pam enjoys running, reading, and playing ukulele…but not all at once. Video and audio of some of her sermons can be accessed at DUUF Sermon Archive.</p>
