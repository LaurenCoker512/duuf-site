                <p>If you are visiting for the first time, we invite you to introduce yourselves at the Welcome Wagon (a cart located in the sanctuary near the name tags) and to sign in your children. You are welcome to contact us ahead of time with any questions or just to let us know you’ll be coming.</p>
                <p>Each week during our worship services, classes are offered for infants, young children, and teenaged youth. Parents, please arrive prior to the start of service to sign in your children at the Welcome Wagon located near the outside entrance to the sanctuary. Wednesday evening youth group for middle and high school, OUTreach Denton’s Sunday evening youth group, and summer camps create other opportunities for connection and learning.</p>
                <h5 class="title title__h5">Sunday Morning</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">9:15am: Nursery Opens.</span> Our nursery is open and staffed for children three years of age or younger.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">9:30am and 11:30am: Worship Begins.</span> Children four years old and up attend the beginning of the service with their parents. 10-15 minutes into the service, children are escorted to their classes.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">10:30am and 12:30pm: Worship Ends.</span> After service is over, parents pick up children at their classroom and/or nursery.</li>

                <h4 class="title title__h4">Adult Faith Development</h4>
                <p>We grow and learn throughout our whole lives (not just as children). At DUUF we create opportunities for adults to explore the big questions of life, grow spiritually and personally, promote social justice, and connect with one another and the larger community. Throughout the year we offer classes, books discussions, life skills workshops, special events, and film screenings. All are welcome to participate.</p>

            <div class="row__6 row__6--left">
                <p>We gather together in spiritual community because we need constant reminders of what matters most in life. In a world of heartbreak and dehumanization, our congregations and communities call us to our better selves. We learn to live with more wisdom, more connection, and more compassion. Our Worship Services are weekly reflections that weave together our own thoughts and experiences with music, beauty, poetry, and words that both comfort and challenge. Our programs for all ages inspire us, and awaken us to our capacities to make a difference in our own lives and in the world.</p>
                <p>Videos of our services can be found on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dentonuuf/featured">YouTube channel</a>, and audio recordings of past services can be found <a href="http://dentonuuf.org/?page_id=1854">here</a>.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I have been going to this church off and on for the last few years, but as soon as I got pregnant I knew it was time to join. I love how they teach the children about love, mindfulness, kindness, and having an open mind. I want my daughter to grow up in a community that supports the path she chooses, whatever that may be, and this is the congregation to do just that! Of course, my husband and I love the portions for adults too! ...
