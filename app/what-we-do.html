                <h4 class="title title__h4">Explorers: Faith Development for Children and Youth</h4>
                <p>If you are visiting for the first time, we invite you to introduce yourselves at the Welcome Wagon (a cart located in the sanctuary near the name tags) and to sign in your children. You are welcome to contact us ahead of time with any questions or just to let us know you’ll be coming.</p>
                <p>Each week during our worship services, classes are offered for infants, young children, and teenaged youth. Parents, please arrive prior to the start of service to sign in your children at the Welcome Wagon located near the outside entrance to the sanctuary. Wednesday evening youth group for middle and high school, OUTreach Denton’s Sunday evening youth group, and summer camps create other opportunities for connection and learning.</p>
                <h5 class="title title__h5">Sunday Morning</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">9:15am: Nursery Opens.</span> Our nursery is open and staffed for children three years of age or younger.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">9:30am and 11:30am: Worship Begins.</span> Children four years old and up attend the beginning of the service with their parents. 10-15 minutes into the service, children are escorted to their classes.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">10:30am and 12:30pm: Worship Ends.</span> After service is over, parents pick up children at their classroom and/or nursery.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="title title__h4">Adult Faith Development</h4>
                <p>We grow and learn throughout our whole lives (not just as children). At DUUF we create opportunities for adults to explore the big questions of life, grow spiritually and personally, promote social justice, and connect with one another and the larger community. Throughout the year we offer classes, books discussions, life skills workshops, special events, and film screenings. All are welcome to participate.</p>
                <h5 class="title title__h5">Inquirers</h5>
                <p>Inquirers, a part of the Faith Forward series originally offered by First UU Church of Dallas, is a series of eight sessions, held most Sundays from 10:30-11:30am (between the services). The sessions can be taken in any order, and no sign-up is necessary. These are casual, small group meetings where a presenter will give information about a different aspect of Unitarian Universalism or DUUF and answer questions on the topic. Both new visitors and long-time members are welcome!</p>
                <h5 class="title title__h5">Covenant Groups</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">What is a covenant group?</span> Groups of 6-10 people who gather twice a month to connect with each other and discuss the themes for that month. The sharing and deep listening that take place foster intimate connections and a sense of shared community.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Why are they called covenant groups?</span> Each group creates its own covenant (or agreement) which outlines the guidelines they choose to abide by in their meetings. Covenants usually list communal expectations such as listening respectfully, speaking one at a time, practicing kindness, and maintaining confidentiality. Groups are also guided by our larger Unitarian Universalist covenant (also referred to as our seven principles).</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">When do they meet?</span> Groups meet twice a month on a regular day, such as the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. Some meet in the evening, while others meet in the morning or afternoon. Groups will begin meeting the second week in April 2018 (and continue until the summer 2019) at DUUF.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">What happens at the meetings?</span> First, opening words are read and a chalice is lit. Then members check-in with a brief update on how they are doing. The majority of the time is spent on reflection and discussion of the topic. To conclude, closing words are read and the chalice is extinguished. Some groups take turns providing refreshments; others do not. Childcare is available. Topics vary and will center around the theme of contrasts and connections.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">How do I sign up for a covenant group?</span> Forms are available through April 5th both online and in paper form in Fellowship Hall. Look for printed forms in Fellowship Hall (where we have coffee hour) or <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/EuBYC6QQseOXzCtP2">sign up online</a>.</li>

            <div class="row__6 row__6--left">
                <p>We gather together in spiritual community because we need constant reminders of what matters most in life. In a world of heartbreak and dehumanization, our congregations and communities call us to our better selves. We learn to live with more wisdom, more connection, and more compassion. Our Worship Services are weekly reflections that weave together our own thoughts and experiences with music, beauty, poetry, and words that both comfort and challenge. Our programs for all ages inspire us, and awaken us to our capacities to make a difference in our own lives and in the world.</p>
                <p>Videos of our services can be found on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dentonuuf/featured" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, and audio recordings of past services can be found <a href="http://dentonuuf.org/?page_id=1854" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
